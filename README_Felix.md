I generated the notebooks from 
- https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/tensorqs_tutorial.html

by manually downloading them and importing them into Databricks and adding them to the repo there

# completed folders:
- [local repo](beginner_source/basics) [web](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/)
